# Admin UI (Next.js) - Feature Flags

## Run (dev)
1. cd admin
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
The admin runs on http://localhost:3001 and proxies /api to backend (http://localhost:3000).

## Notes
- Tailwind build runs on postinstall; you may need to run the tailwind CLI manually if not installed globally.
- This is a skeleton with UI components; for production, integrate shadcn/ui for richer components.
